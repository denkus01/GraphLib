**Graph library.**
Library to find a path in a graph, a graph-wide traversal algorithm is used.
 Two types of graphs are implemented - Oriented and Non-oriented
 The graph consists of the following methods:
 
 * `addNode(Node node)` - add new Node;
 * `addEdge(Node from, Node to) `- add new Edge (oriented or not)
 * ` getPath(Node start, Node finish)` - find path between dwo nodes.
